# Affiliates

- serious companies with a system, drivers, vehicles.

- use them when rides cannot be covered - house drivers are busy.

- there are many of them and they can be reached out in many ways.

- How to choose affiliate:

1. Check Google reviews - usually the first signal of the attitude.
    - Check working hours.
    - Check the quality of website - if it's outdated, it's a bad sign.
    - Call and ask for *all-inclusive(tax, tolls... - final rate)* affiliate rate, while letting them know that we call on behalf of limo company. - price is based on affiliate price. Point out that driver needs to represent *the company*, not affiliate.
    - price is based on affiliate price, so before giving a price to the client, it's necessary to get the affiliate price.
    - a driver needs to represent the company which dispatched him, he is not allowed to promote the affiliate company in any way.
    - the total price is: affiliate price + markup price.
    - to book affiliate drive we need to provide company's credit card info.
    - send email to affiliate(drive detail, affiliate price).

2. Use *Limoanywhere*:
    - if affiliate uses `Limoanywhere`.
    - Network -> Locate Affiliates -> Country Selection
    - after finding a company go to: view -> establish affiliate relationship.
    - after filtering the results based on requirements, research can be done(website, reviews, etc.)
    - Network requests can be seen in the *Network Request* page.

3. [NLA ride](https://www.nlaride.com/):
    - National Limo Association.
    - most of the firms are NLA members.
    - they are considered reliable.

- *Farm-in(FIN)* - rent a drive to another company
- *Farm-out(FOT)* - rent a drive from another company.

### Farm-out procedure

- in order to send a network request, the company must be in the system of *Limoanywhere*(`My Office -> Company Resources -> Affiliates`: there is a list of affiliates)

- if the company doesn't have *Limoanywhere* use 'Add New Affiliate' section under `My Office -> Company Resources -> Affiliates`

- after finding the drive we want to farm out:
1. set the FOT cost.
2. the name of affiliate.
3. select button farm-out.
4. if affiliate uses *Limoanywhere*:
    1. select *LA NET*.
    2. fill in the information about the affiliate and trip.
    3. choose vehicle type.
    4. press complete to send the reservation.
    5. affiliate should accept the drive.
5. if affiliate doesn't use *Limoanywhere*:
    1. choose the affiliate(always check if the affiliate has *Limoanywhere*)
    2. Use the button manually.
    3. Send a message asking them if they will accept the job.

- How to check if a drive is farmed out?
    - The first indicator is FOT Type on Dispatch page.
    - inhouse rides will have INH Type on Dispatch page.
    - farmed in rides fill have FIN Type on Dispatch page.
    - when the details are check it can be confirmed, the important information is reference number.
    - driver should update the status of the ride, so we should check with the driver.
    - driver's contact information are also available.
    - check the driver just-in-case, there should be communication.
    - it can be seen if the ride was farmed out using *LA Net* or *Manual*.

- if the company uses *Limoanywhere* we will be able to see the statuses of the FOT rides.

### Affiliate Work

- keep an eye on the drivers/rides/statuses.

- if necessary reach to the driver to check the status if something is strange.

- manual *FOT* is more tricky, because without limoanywhere it's harder to follow what is going on.
